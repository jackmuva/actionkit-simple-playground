## Playground Goals
### Our goal: 
Have prospects and customers understand **what ActionKit is and what the value is**. We want to give them a frictionless experience 
on using actionkit and demo a few popular use cases

### Why our audience cares: 
they want to learn more about what actionkit is and what/how they can build with it

### Customer journey: 
we assume that the audience has some context of what Paragon and Actionkit is. We will provide tooltips, links to docs, 
api calls, and an intro page to remind/provide the audience with additional context on what ActionKit is and use cases they can 
build with it
